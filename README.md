# Time Series Analysis with LSTM
In this repository, i focus on analyzing time-series data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Specifically,  utilize the yfinance dataset, extracting historical stock market data, and employ various time-series analysis techniques such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and LSTM for prediction.

## Contents
* 1- Data Collection: Utilize the yfinance library to fetch historical stock market data.
* 2- Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalization, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Time-Series Analysis:
* 3- Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF): Conduct unit root tests to check for stationarity in the time series.
* 4- ARIMA Model: Implement AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models for time series forecasting.
* 5- LSTM Model: Build Long Short-Term Memory networks for time series prediction, leveraging the memory capabilities of recurrent neural networks.
* 6- Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
* 7- Visualization: Visualize the original time series data, model predictions, and evaluation results to gain insights into the forecasting performance.
